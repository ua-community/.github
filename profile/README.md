User & Agents is "open by default."

We are a community space focused on shaping the future of user-agent systems. Our goal is to empower individuals with software that enables them to create their own agency. 

We collaborate with organizations and communities eager to address challenges at the intersection of web platform transitions, end-user programming, on-device AI, and cognitive architectures. Take a look at some of our pinned repositories to get a sense of what we do. Want to make a contribution? Make a pull request!
